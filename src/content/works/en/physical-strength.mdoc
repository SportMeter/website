**Case Study:** Injury Prevention Pilot\n**Website:** [https://hockey-health.nl/](https://hockey-health.nl/)


### Process

Our collaboration with NexaCore Systems began with a comprehensive analysis of their production automation infrastructure. Through collaborative sessions with factory managers and automation engineers, we identified key bottlenecks in their production systems. Our team used a data-driven approach, implementing IoT sensors and real-time monitoring solutions. We developed a custom AI-powered control system that adapts to various production requirements while ensuring optimal raw material utilization.

### Result

The implementation led to a 35% reduction in production downtime and a 50% improvement in preventive maintenance accuracy. The new smart production platform enabled real-time decision-making capabilities, resulting in a 28% increase in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). NexaCore's innovative approach has positioned them as industry leaders in Industrial IoT solutions.
