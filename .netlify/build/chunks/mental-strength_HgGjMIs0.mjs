SportMeter is a simple check-in tool that provides direct insight into the physical, mental, and social well-being of their teams. With proven templates, you can quickly ask the right questions, which serve as a social safety net for injury prevention, mental resilience, and strengthening team dynamics.\n\n{% Video src=\"@/assets/works/mentale-kracht/infographic.mp4\" /%}\n\n### Reasoning\n\nWe started this pilot in response to urgent practical issues related to the mental health of athletes and coaches. Research has shown that a significant portion of elite athletes and coaches experience psychological complaints within sports clubs. Despite the positive influence of sport on mental well-being, structured support for mental health within sports clubs remains scarce.\n\nResearch from the Dutch government shows that 91% of sports clubs have no specific sports or exercise offerings aimed at mental health (2023 study). Only 4% of sports clubs have a specific policy to support mental health, revealing a worrying gap between supply and demand. We believe that your club can play a key role in creating a mentally positive sports climate.\n\n### Result\n\nWith fast feedback loops, these professionals can safely and efficiently receive feedback through short check-in questions, giving them quick insight into the needs and experiences of athletes. The tool facilitates easy follow-up through automatic scheduling of check-ins around sports moments. SportMeter allows coaches to choose their own check-in questions, so they can collect personalized and targeted information.\n\nRequest a no-obligation demo via [email](sportmeter.app@gmail.com), or get in touch via [Request Pilot 2025](https://veiligevereniging.nl/contact/).\n";
